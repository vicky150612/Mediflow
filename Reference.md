## üß© Review & Suggestions

### ‚úÖ What‚Äôs Good
- **Role-Based Routing**: Auto-redirect based on user role
- **Simple Navigation**: Few routes, easy to follow
- **Authentication**: Protected routes and logout support

## üîß Areas for Improvement

### 1. Navigation Consistency and Visibility
- Introduce a **sidebar or top nav** for logged-in users:
  - Dashboard
  - Files
  - Access List
  - Logout
- Highlight active/selected page

### 2. Doctor Navigation
- Add "My Patients" list
- Show accessible patient files directly
- Remove reliance on patient ID search

### 3. Patient Navigation
- Use persistent navigation (sidebar or top nav)
- Add **breadcrumbs** or page titles for context

### 4. Route Protection
- `/files` and `/accesslist` should be accessible **only by patients**
- Doctors should not reach them even via direct URL
- Add a **404/fallback route** for unknown URLs

### 5. User Experience
- After logout, redirect to `/login` and **clear state**
- Show **notifications** on:
  - Adding/removing doctor
  - File upload success/failure
- **Loading indicators** during async actions (file upload spinner, prescription list loading, etc.)
- Disabled upload button during file upload
- Improved feedback on file upload/delete and prescription actions
- Responsive, modern UI for all patient and doctor views

### 6. Mobile Responsiveness
- Ensure navigation adapts (e.g., hamburger menu)
- Responsive layout and buttons
